The project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and analyzing tumors in medical images, such as mammograms. By utilizing advanced image processing techniques, the project focuses on segmenting tumors and extracting important geometric features such as radius, circumference, and area. These features help assess the size and shape of tumors, which are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring breast cancer.
